# ft-linear-regression

In this project, I create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
In the project there is already a dataset. However the program can run with any other dataset.

## How to run project

- Create virtual environment for the project: `make env`
- Activate the environment: `source my_env/bin/activate`
- Install needed libraries (mostly for displaying graph): `make install`
- Train model (you need to train the model before being able to use it to predict): `python3 LinearRegressionModel.py`
- Run predict model: `python3 predict.py`
